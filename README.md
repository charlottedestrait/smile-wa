# WorkAdventure Smile's Maps

## Daily usage

* Arrow keys to move
* `Shift` to run
* `Ctrl` + mouse scroll wheel to zoom in/zoom out

## Zone specificities

* You may find silent zones where nobody is allowed to talk for privacy
* You may find zones where pressing `Space` is required to trigger a Jitsi meet or any other action (keep a look at the bottom of your screen)

## Performance

### Settings

When in WorkAdventure, on the top left there is a menu with settings.

You can lower the game and video qualities to diminish the resource requirement.

### Chrome/Chromium browser

Ensure the `Use hardware acceleration when available` option is enabled, otherwise your computer will burn.
